# Modular data pipelines improve reusability and reliability for ETL and analytics

Pipelines route data from a source to a destination. All analytics and extract-transfer-load (ETL) involve them. Pipelines come in all shapes and sizes but modular pipelines can be best if you are working collaboratively, without too much legacy tech, and have a big backlog of similar but different data and analytics tasks.

This readme is a companion to a video and all code is in this GitHub repo.

## What exactly is a modular data pipeline (MDP)?

## What are the benefits?

## How do they work with the Amphora Data platform?

## Sounds good, what do I need to start coding?
