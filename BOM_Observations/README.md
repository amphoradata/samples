## Downloading Stations.txt

You can download a ZIP file from BOM here: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/cdo/about/sitedata.shtml

Extract the ZIP to get `stations.txt` Make sure to manually delete the latst lines in `stations.txt` before running `extract.py` so it ends with a line of station information.
